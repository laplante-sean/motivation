# Motivation

So you wanna play video games and get fit, but you want to play real video games because fitness video games get old too fast? Well if you have a supported smart trainer, now you can!

"Motivation" is Stationary Bike "Smart" trainer gaming motivator. It connects to Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE) smart trainers and disables your game controller if you drop below a configured power output.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7+
1. A supported smart trainer (see below)
1. A Windows PC
    * Controller "disabling" is hacky right now and only implemented for Windows

## Support

_Currently only support 1 smart trainer. Will need contributions and testing from community to add support for others. (b/c I can't afford to buy them all._

1. Wahoo Kickr SNAP

## Tested games

1. Halo Reach from the Master Chief Collection

## Tested controllers

1. XBox 360 Controller connected to PC with the USB XBox 360 Wireless dongle thing.

## Setup

1. Clone repo
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `python motivation.py -h`

Happy peddling.
